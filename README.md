# Brief summary of script #

Note: This program is still in development.  This program will create a project directory structure with template files necessary for managing and analyzing data, as well as writing up a manuscript.  This allows for a standardized approach to having modular research projects. 

# Dependencies #

## --- for running the program ##

* Bash, or any shell program
* Make

## --- for using the generated files/scripts ##

* SAS --- scripts containing analysis 
* R --- scripts containing analysis
* Make --- running commands to generate results output and the manuscript
* LaTeX --- creating manuscript
* VUE --- making concept maps and directed acyclic graphs
* Docear --- organizing literature and notes

# Purpose of script #

I created this program/script to make creating a folder structure and template files easier when I start a new research/analysis project.  My aim was to have the research project directory contain all the files necessary for a manuscript.  This way, it is entirely self-contained and modular, so that if other researchers ask how the results were obtained or for the code, I can easily send it to them.  The reason I put it up on GitHub is to share partly this program, but mostly the idea of having some way to standardize the creation of a research project.
